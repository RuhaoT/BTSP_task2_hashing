# To: Ruhao:

For this task, we aim to evaluate the hashing performance of our proposed BTSP models.

Please use the script ./main/main_hash_mnist as an example for running the experiments.
All control models are implemented in the model directory.
The key objective is to explore under which parameter configurations the BTSP-based data-dependent hashing can outperform the FLY algorithms.

I suggest focusing on
(1) optimizing variables such as  fq, binary_coding, and other relevant parameters (?we could discuss it first). Achieving consistent conclusions across at least two datasets would be highly valuable.
(2) implement equ.(1) on our overleaf, try to search the threshold \theta and the learning rate, and compare the performance with the (1) setups.
